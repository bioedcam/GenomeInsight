/** Polygenic trait-architecture education card (SW-A2 / roadmap #30).
 *
 * A static, collapsible explainer shown alongside polygenic scores so a
 * percentile is never read as a deterministic prediction:
 *   - twin > SNP > PRS heritability (most heritability is missing);
 *   - cross-ancestry portability falls with genetic distance (Ding 2023, r≈−0.95);
 *   - calibration is not accuracy.
 *
 * §12.4 — educational only; changes no score, percentile, CI, or evidence level.
 *
 * Canonical source of the three facts + citation: the backend
 * `PRS_TRAIT_ARCHITECTURE` block in `backend/analysis/prs.py` (attached to every
 * PRS finding's `detail_json`). This card is the **reader-facing register** of
 * that same content — the substantive claims (h²_twin > h²_SNP > h²_PRS; Ding
 * 2023 r≈−0.95; calibration ≠ accuracy) and the Ding citation are kept identical
 * to the backend block by hand; only the surrounding prose is friendlier. The
 * card is section-level (not per-finding), so it intentionally renders the static
 * copy rather than threading per-finding detail_json through the API/types. If
 * you edit either side, update the other to keep them in sync.

        How to read a polygenic score

          Twin-study heritability is larger than SNP heritability, which is larger than the
          variance this score explains (h²_twin {">"} h²_SNP {">"} h²_PRS). A polygenic score
          captures only a fraction of even the heritable part of a trait.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Accuracy drops across ancestries.</span>{" "}
          Polygenic-score accuracy falls roughly linearly with genetic distance from the
          score's training population (Ding et al., Nature 2023; Pearson r ≈ −0.95 across 84
          traits), so a score derived mainly in one population can be miscalibrated in another.

        <p>
          <span className="font-medium text-foreground">Calibration is not accuracy.</span>{" "}
          Even a correctly ranked percentile does not predict your individual outcome — most
          trait variation is environmental and non-PRS genetic.
