"""Array-genotyping confidence (Weedon-PPV reliability badge).

EXPANSION_STRATEGY second-wave SW-A11 / roadmap #14. A genotyping array confirms
*common* variants almost perfectly but is increasingly unreliable as a variant
gets rarer — Weedon 2021 (BMJ; PMID 33589468) found array calls for common
variants concordant with sequencing >99% of the time, yet only ~16% of array
calls for variants rarer than 0.001% were confirmed, and ~4% for very rare
ClinVar Pathogenic/Likely-pathogenic variants in BRCA1/BRCA2.

This module reads the Phase-F annotation columns ``annotated_variants
.gnomad_af_popmax`` (F15) and the F12 catalogue signals and turns them into a
per-finding **reliability flag** for actionable ClinVar P/LP findings.

This is a **reliability flag only** (mirrors the gene-constraint badge in
``backend.analysis.gene_constraint``): it NEVER changes a finding's
``evidence_level`` or ``clinvar_significance``. A low-reliability flag does not
make a true call false — it means an array call at that frequency should be
confirmed in a CLIA/accredited lab before any medical action (the same
responsible-return framing as ``backend.analysis.return_framing.CLIA_CONFIRMATION``).

The ClinGen 6-tier gene-disease-validity half of SW-A11 is deferred until the
ClinGen public download is available; this module ships the Weedon-PPV half.
