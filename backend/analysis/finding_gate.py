"""Shared finding-surfacing gate (validation strategy D2; F8).

A genotyping chip reports a call at *every* probe regardless of biology, so a
finding can be surfaced that is impossible for the individual — most starkly a
Y-chromosome "Pathogenic SRY" finding on a female (XX) sample. ``is_surfaceable``
is the single predicate every finding generator consults before emitting a
finding, so the chromosome/sex rule lives in one place rather than being
re-derived (or forgotten) per module.

Biological sex is inferred once per run via
:func:`backend.services.sex_inference.infer_biological_sex` and threaded in, so
this module stays a pure predicate with no DB access.

    Conservative by design: a finding is dropped only when the contradiction is
    unambiguous *and* sex is confidently known. Today that is a Y-chromosome
    finding on a confidently-``"XX"`` sample (biologically impossible — F8). When
    sex is ``"manual_review"`` / ``"unknown"`` / ``None`` nothing is dropped,
