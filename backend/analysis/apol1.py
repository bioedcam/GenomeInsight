"""APOL1 kidney-risk module (G1/G2 + N264K modifier) — §9 / roadmap #27.

Thin adapter over the shared declarative risk-genotype caller, injecting the
sample's inferred ancestry so the engine's ancestry gate can apply. APOL1 risk
is **recessive** (two risk alleles, any combination of G1 and G2), **ancestry-
gated** (the G1/G2 alleles are near-absent and unvalidated outside recent
African ancestry), and modified by **N264K** (rs73885316), which attenuates
G2-associated risk. The G2 allele is a 6-bp deletion (rs71785313) that is often
off-chip; an untyped G2 yields a partial genotype, never a false low-risk call.
