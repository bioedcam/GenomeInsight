"""Runs-of-Homozygosity (ROH) / FROH autozygosity estimate — roadmap #29.

A clean-room sliding-run detector (PLINK ``--homozyg`` equivalent, no GPL code)
that scans the autosomal genotypes for long stretches of consecutive homozygous
calls — the signature of autozygosity (a segment inherited identical-by-descent
from a shared ancestor). The summed ROH length over the autosomal genome gives
**FROH**, a standard genomic estimate of autozygosity.

What this is *not* (the load-bearing honesty guardrail, §12): FROH is a
genome-wide *estimate* derived from one array, **not** a diagnosis or a statement
about whether a person's parents are related. Long ROH arise from many benign
causes — population history, genuine isolation, large pericentromeric LD blocks —
and a single chip cannot distinguish them. The finding states this plainly and
never names or infers a relationship.

Method (parameters documented and tuned for a dense ~600–700k-marker array):

  - Homozygosity is read straight from the genotype string (``"AA"`` hom,
    ``"AG"`` het, ``"--"``/haploid/indel → missing); ROH is strand-independent so
    no ref/alt is needed.
  - Per autosome, SNPs are walked in position order. A run extends across
    consecutive non-missing SNPs while (a) it accumulates at most
    ``HET_TOLERANCE`` heterozygous calls (genotyping-error slack) and (b) no gap
    between adjacent typed SNPs exceeds ``MAX_GAP_KB`` (so coverage gaps /
    centromeres break a run instead of being spanned).
  - A run is recorded as an ROH segment when, after trimming to homozygous
    endpoints, it spans ≥ ``MIN_ROH_KB`` and contains ≥ ``MIN_ROH_SNPS``
    homozygous SNPs.
  - ``FROH = Σ segment length / AUTOSOMAL_GENOME_KB`` (a fixed ~2.77 Gb
    denominator, the convention from McQuillan 2008, so FROH is comparable
    across samples rather than array-relative).

This is a **route-triggered** metric (``POST /api/analysis/roh/run``), not part of
the auto-run :mod:`backend.analysis.run_all` pipeline: it is a full-genome scan
that always emits a summary finding, so running it on demand keeps the standard
post-annotation finding set (and its validation golden snapshot) unchanged.
