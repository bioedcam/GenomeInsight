"""Canonical chromosome sort order — dependency-free.

Extracted from ``vcf_export`` so lightweight data-prep scripts (the Phase A
union builders) can sort by chromosome without importing the VCF exporter,
which transitively pulls in ``backend.db`` / ``backend.config``. Both this
module and ``vcf_export`` share the same ``CHROM_ORDER`` so output ordering is
identical wherever it is used.
